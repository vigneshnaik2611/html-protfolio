  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Vigneshwar Bhukya — a front-end developer in the making with solid skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, currently evolving into a full-stack developer. While working night shifts, I’ve been consistently dedicating my days to expanding my coding abilities, mastering both client-side and server-side technologies.</p>

  <p>With a strong sense of discipline from balancing work, sleep, and personal growth, I approach development with a mindset of continuous improvement and clean design. Whether it’s building responsive UI or diving into back-end logic, I strive to create seamless, user-friendly web experiences.</p>

  <p>I’m currently focusing on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Learning React, Node.js, and MongoDB</li>
    <li>Strengthening my understanding of version control (Git/GitHub)</li>
    <li>Building real-world projects to enhance my portfolio</li>
    <li>Practicing smart time management to maintain progress despite a night-shift lifestyle</li>
  </ul>
