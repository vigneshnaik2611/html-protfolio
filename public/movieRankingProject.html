    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>

    <p>Interstellar is, in my opinion, Christopher Nolan’s best film—and it sits firmly at the top of my favorites list. What makes it stand out is its breathtaking and detailed portrayal of space, time dilation, black holes, and the complexities of space travel. The way it combines emotional depth with scientific imagination is truly unmatched, making it a cinematic masterpiece that continues to fascinate me.</p>

    <h3>Hi Nanna</h3>

    <p>Hi Nanna creates an emotional vibe through its soulful music and engaging storyline that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The interval twist and the heartfelt backstory add depth, making each moment more impactful. What truly sets it apart is the ending—it leaves you with a whole new perspective and emotional resonance that lingers long after the movie ends.</p>

    <h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>

    <p>Avengers: Endgame stands as Marvel’s biggest cinematic milestone and the epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It brings together all the beloved superheroes in a final showdown against the powerful Thanos, the central villain of the saga. The story brilliantly weaves in time travel through Quantum particles—an idea introduced by Ant-Man in earlier films—adding a thrilling twist to the plot. With its intense action and emotional moments, the movie keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. However, the heartbreaking sacrifice of Iron Man, a.k.a. Tony Stark, left many fans emotional and marked the end of an era in the Marvel Universe.</p>
